ZJAILBUILD
----------

zjailbuild is a combination of zbuild and zjail (described below).
Using this script to stage a given build in a jail.

All commands accepts a -h option for displaying help.

ZBUILD
------

This script will run all scripts in sub directory 'stages/xxx' in
lexicographically order including recursion to subdirs. xxx is the
stages selected from command line arg 1:

zbuild build mystage

will run stages in 'stages/mystage'

The my stage directory contain symlinks into the packages
directory and are run in lexicographically order.

A shortcut to use this on a remote host is to use an alias in
your .bashrc file:

alias zbuild="ssh <builduser@buildhost> ./zbuild/zbuild"


ZJAIL
-----

This script is a simple shell script that when executed will
put your current session into a jail. Everything done in 
jail works just as if you were on the base system but 
changes made will not be made to the base system but
in the jail only. 

This means that you can test package installation etc. 
without affecting the base system. 

A optional ip and hostname can be provided in order
for the jail to use that.

NOTICE: the system root directories 
	bin dev emul lib lib32 lib64 opt proc sbin sys
	are shared between all jail and the base 	
	system and should not be changed from 
	within a jail (only read).



ZSERVICEFORWARD
---------------

Forwards traffic to a local IP:PORT to the base system local IP and
same port. Usefull for using some of the base systems services on the
jail ip. 



TODO
----

* Figure out a way to make the build ordered from web ui 
  automatically get clean up since they are 
  build i separate directories in order to be able
  to do simultanous builds.
  The directories may very well be named by the build ID 
  in the database.
